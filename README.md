# Office 365 for IT ProsPractical 365 Lab PowerShell  examples

## Introduction
The files in this repository represent labs built by [Practical 365 Author Nicolas Blank](https://practical365.com/author/nicolas-blank/) for the purpose of creating repeatable guidance and builds which are reproducable by the readers.

These labs are built using [AutomatedLab](https://github.com/AutomatedLab/AutomatedLab) unless specified.


When you build your AutomatedLab setup for the first time DO NOT use the MSI installer, rather install from the PowerShell Gallery using the cmdlet Install-Module.
